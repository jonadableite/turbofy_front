// 🔐 SECURITY: Centralizing Prisma client prevents leaking multiple DB connections and allows setting up safe connection options
// 📈 SCALABILITY: Re-uses a single PrismaClient instance to avoid exhausting database connections under load
// 🛠️ MAINTAINABILITY: Encapsulates Prisma initialization, easing future swap or config tweaks
// 🧪 TESTABILITY: Can be mocked in tests by jest.mock()
// 🔄 EXTENSIBILITY: Additional middlewares (e.g., logging, tracing) can be plugged here

/**
 * @security Uses environment variable validation (see env.ts) to retrieve DATABASE_URL securely
 * @performance Ensures a single global PrismaClient to leverage connection pooling
 * @maintainability Isolated in infrastructure layer respecting Hexagonal Architecture
